# This script takes content that is stored in site_text and outputs language strings suitable for inclusion in the language files.
# It was used for porting from the old site_text/dbstruct method of storing default site content to the new language string system.
# It's been included in case users have a large amount of locally translated content in site_text that needs to be pulled out in to language files.
