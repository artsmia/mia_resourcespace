# StaticSync Path to metadata mapping
# ------------------------
# It is possible to take path information and map selected parts of the path to metadata fields.
# For example, if you added a mapping for '/projects/' and specified that the second level should be 'extracted' means that 'ABC' would be extracted as metadata into the specified field if you added a file to '/projects/ABC/'
# Hence meaningful metadata can be specified by placing the resource files at suitable positions within the static
# folder heirarchy.
# Use the line below as an example. Repeat this for every mapping you wish to set up
#	$staticsync_mapfolders[]=array
#		(
#		"match"=>"/projects/",
#		"field"=>10,
#		"level"=>2
#		);
#
# You can also now enter "access" in "field" to set the access level for the resource. The value must match the name of the access level
# in the default local language. Note that custom access levels are not supported. For example, the mapping below would set anything in 
# the projects/restricted folder to have a "Restricted" access level.
#	$staticsync_mapfolders[]=array
#		(
#		"match"=>"/projects/restricted",
#		"field"=>"access",
#		"level"=>2
#		);
#
# Suffix to use for alternative files folder
# If staticsync finds a folder in the same directory as a file with the same name as a file but with this suffix appended, then files in the folder will be treated as alternative files for the give file.
# For example a folder/file structure might look like:
# /staticsync_folder/myfile.jpg
# /staticsync_folder/myfile.jpg_alternatives/alternative1.jpg
# /staticsync_folder/myfile.jpg_alternatives/alternative2.jpg
# /staticsync_folder/myfile.jpg_alternatives/alternative3.jpg
